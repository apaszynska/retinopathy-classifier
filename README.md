# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection with AI

This project aims to develop an AI model that can detect diabetic retinopathy using retinal images from the Messidor-2 dataset. It uses computer vision techniques and deep learning (CNNs) to classify images based on the presence of diabetic retinopathy.

## 👁 Dataset

I use the **Messidor-2** dataset, which is publicly available **for research and educational purposes only**.

You can request access and download it here:  
👉 https://www.adcis.net/en/third-party/messidor/

> ⚠️ Due to licensing restrictions, the dataset is **not included** in this repository.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `data/` — place Messidor-2 images here (locally)
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model training
- `models/` — saved models

## 🧪 Methods

- Image preprocessing (resizing, normalization)
- Transfer learning using pretrained CNNs
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix
